## üöÄ Built with

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

The UI components were written using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), while [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) takes care of all the boring stuff such as bundling, code splitting and serving assets.

Even though this was built over Next.js runtime framework I opted for mostly not using `next/router` and `next/link` as I was exploring the idea of creating a "hybrid" single page app experience (content sits behind a login anyway and SEO wasn't a requirement) where I can throw some SSR/SSG in the mix if needed (e.g. login, landing page).
The cool part about it is that we have most of the other Next.js benefits like great DX, close to zero config, `Image` component and so on without having to worry about persistent layouts.

The content is provided by the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and I've used [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/) for managing server state and data fetching. The API authentication goes through a couple of Next.js serverless functions but is mostly handled by the Spotify API.

As far as testing goes, I've used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit tests, while [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) takes care of the e2e tests. Testing data is generated by a [Fishery](https://github.com/thoughtbot/fishery) factory which uses [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) under the hood for random but valid data.
